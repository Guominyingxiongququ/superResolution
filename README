############### JOR Code #######################

1. This is a matlab code, and you may start with run_JOR.m.  

2. The code for training JOR is added, start with JOR_training.m. 
   The trained model will be saved into folder './models', or you
   can download the trained model from the project page 
   http://people.ee.ethz.ch/~daid/JOR/ and put them to folder './models'     

3. The code depends on vl-feat library. The library can be downloaded
   from the website at http://www.vlfeat.org/. For the sake of convenience,
   we have included vlfeat-0.9.16 into this code package. 

4. The code is built on top of Radu Timofte's code for their work A+. Also, 
   the code of SRCNN by Chao Dong and colleages are also included for comparison.   

5. Feel free to contact us if you have any questions about using the code.
